# Ajouter un service de message 

Exercice original : https://www.katacoda.com/courses/openshift/middleware/amq-getting-started-broker

Overview
AMQ provides fast, lightweight, and secure messaging for Internet-scale applications. AMQ components use industry-standard message protocols 
and support a wide range of programming languages and operating environments. AMQ gives you the strong foundation you need to build modern 
distributed applications.

What is AMQ Broker?
AMQ Broker is a pure-Java multiprotocol message broker. Itâ€™s built on an efficient, asynchronous core, with a fast native journal for message 
persistence and the option of shared-nothing state replication for high availability.

Persistence - A fast, native-IO journal or a JDBC-based store
High availability - Shared store or shared-nothing state replication
Advanced queueing - Last value queues, message groups, topic hierarchies, and large message support
Multiprotocol - AMQP 1.0, MQTT, STOMP, OpenWire, and HornetQ Core
AMQ Broker is based on the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis project.

What will you learn
In this tutorial you will learn how to setup a Red Hat AMQ message broker instance running on OpenShift.

# Creating an Initial Project
To get started, first we need to login to OpenShift.

To login to the OpenShift cluster use the following commmand in your Terminal:

oc login -u developer -p developer 2886795276-8443-kitek02.environments.katacoda.com --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

You can click on the above command (and all others in this scenario) to automatically copy it into the terminal and execute it.

This will log you in using the credentials:

Username: developer
Password: developer
You should see the output:

Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
For this scenario lets create a project called messaging by running the command:

oc new-project messaging

You should see output similar to:

Now using project "messaging" on server "https://172.17.0.41:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
In the next, you will deploy a new instance of the AMQ broker.

# Deploying a Broker Instance
With the project space now available, let's create the broker instance.

To allow ingress traffic to the messaging destinations, configure the required secrets with the following command:

oc create sa amq-service-account

Add cluster capabilities to service account

oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:messaging:amq-service-account

Create a new app using the OpenShift command:

oc new-app amq-broker-71-basic -p AMQ_PROTOCOL=openwire,amqp,stomp,mqtt -p AMQ_USER=amquser -p AMQ_PASSWORD=amqpassword -p AMQ_QUEUES=example

This command will create a broker instance with the OpenWire and AMQP protocols enabled. At the same time, will create a queue named example.

You should see the output:

--> Deploying template "openshift/amq-broker-71-basic" to project messaging

     JBoss AMQ Broker 7.1 (Ephemeral, no SSL)
     ---------
     Application template for JBoss AMQ brokers. These can be deployed as standalone or in a mesh. This template doesn't feature SSL support.

     A new messaging service has been created in your project. It will handle the protocol(s) "openwire,amqp,stomp,mqtt". The username/password 
     for accessing the service is amquser/amqpassword.

     * With parameters:
        * Application Name=broker
        * AMQ Protocols=openwire,amqp,stomp,mqtt
        * Queues=example
        * Topics=
        * AMQ Username=amquser
        * AMQ Password=amqpassword
        * AMQ Role=admin
        * AMQ Name=broker
        * AMQ Global Max Size=100 gb
        * ImageStream Namespace=openshift

--> Creating resources ...
    route "console" created
    service "broker-amq-jolokia" created
    service "broker-amq-amqp" created
    service "broker-amq-mqtt" created
    service "broker-amq-stomp" created
    service "broker-amq-tcp" created
    deploymentconfig "broker-amq" created
--> Success
    Access your application via route 'console-messaging.2886795275-80-kitek02.environments.katacoda.com'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
When the provisioning of the broker finishes, you will be set to start using the service. In the next step you will deploy a simple messging application.

# Creating a Simple Messaging Application
The sample project in the upper right part side of the screen, shows the components of your sample Node.js project. This project uses Red Hat 
OpenShift Application Runtimes, a set of open source cloud native application runtimes for modern applications.

The app implements a simple messaging greeting service that simply sends a Hello World! to a queue and the same application listens in the same 
queue for greeting messages. We use the Red Hat AMQ JavaScript Client to create a connection to the messaging broker to send and receive messages.

The AMQ Clients is a suite of AMQP 1.0 messaging APIs that allow you to make any application a messaging application. It includes both 
industry-standard APIs such as JMS and new event-driven APIs that make it easy to integrate messaging anywhere. The AMQ Javascript Client is 
based on the AMQP Rhea Project.

## Inspect the application code
Click the links below to open each file and inspect its contents:

package.json - Metadata about the project: name, version, dependencies, and other information needed to build and maintain the project.
app.js - Main logic of the sample application.
## Install Dependencies
Switch to the application directory in the command line by issuing the following command:

cd /root/projects/amq-examples/amq-js-demo

Dependencies are listed in the package.json file and declare which external projects this sample app requires. To download and install them, 
run the following command:

npm install

It will take a few seconds to download, and you should see a final report such as

added 140 packages in 2.937s
## Deploy
Build and deploy the project using the following command:

npm run openshift

This uses NPM and the Nodeshift project to build and deploy the sample application to OpenShift using the containerized Node.js runtime.

The build and deploy may take a minute or two. Wait for it to complete.

You should see INFO complete at the end of the build output, and you should not see any obvious errors or failures. In the next step you will 
explore OpenShift's web console to check your application is running.

# Access the application running on OpenShift
After the previous step build finishes, it will take less than a minute for the application to become available.

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser.

## Open the OpenShift Web Console
To get a feel for how the web console works, click on the "OpenShift Console" tab.

OpenShift Console Tab

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter your username and password and then log in.

Your credentials are:

Username: developer
Password: developer
Web Console Login

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a list of projects that your user has permission to work with.

Click on your the messaging project name to be taken to the project overview page.

Messaging Project

You will see the messaging broker and your brand new application running. Click in the amq-js-demo row to expand the panel.

AMQ Javascript Demo

Click in the 1 pod inside the blue circle to access the actual pod running your application.

Application Pod

Click in the logs tab to access the application container logs.

Log

You will see a message every 10 seconds with the following text:

Message received: Hello World!

This message is been sent and received to the example queue by the application you just deployed.
